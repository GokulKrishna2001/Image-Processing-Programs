The images used for the programs has been given in the 'images' folder.
The dataset used for image classification program is in 'dataset'.
The xml sign for Object Detection program is given as 'stop_data.xml'.
Some of the programs needs additional packages to be installed, they are specified in the programs.
All program outputs are shown using matplotlib.
